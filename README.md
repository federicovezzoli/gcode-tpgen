# G-Code Test Pattern Generator

A modern web app for generating diagnostic G-code patterns to calibrate and test CNC machines, routers, and plotters.

> **Forked from [vector76/gcode_tpgen](https://github.com/vector76/gcode_tpgen)** — this project is a full rewrite of the original single-file tool, rebuilt with a modern stack and responsive UI while keeping the original G-code generation logic faithful to the source.

## What it does

Select a test mode, configure the parameters, hit **Generate** — you get ready-to-run G-code plus an SVG toolpath preview. Download the `.gcode` file and run it on your machine.

### Test modes

| Mode | Purpose |
|---|---|
| X / Y / XY Ruler | Tick marks every 1 mm to detect steps/mm errors and backlash |
| Perimeter Ruler | Rulers along all four sides of the work area |
| Squareness Marks | L-shaped corner marks to check axis squareness |
| Z-Test Corners | X-shaped marks at corners to amplify surface height errors |
| Z-Test Grid | Same, distributed across a grid |
| Dense Segments | Tests firmware parsing speed with configurable segment lengths |
| Accel X / Y | Acceleration ramp test using M201/M204, measures deflection |
| Text | ASCII text via G5 Bézier curves (requires firmware support) |
| Surfacing | Unidirectional surface milling passes |
| Hog-Out | Feedrate vs. deflection test using top-hat profiles |
